#Ask 1 - Identifying the Data Set
Identify and describe your dataset
This data set contains sales transactions from UK-based online retailers over the course of a year. Since 2007, this London-based store has sold presents and household goods for both adults and children online. Small enterprises can also buy in bulk and sell to additional clients via retail outlet channels. They have clients from all over the world who often make purchases for themselves directly.

Why is important and what appeals to you about it
It is crucial and appealing because e-commerce has emerged as a new avenue for promoting business growth. Businesses can get access to and develop a larger market presence through e-commerce by offering less expensive and more effective distribution channels for their goods or services. The way individuals shop and use goods and services has also altered as a result of e-commerce. To simply get their purchases delivered to their homes, many consumers are using their computers or other smart devices to place orders.

Is this data suitable for dimensional modeling and analytical analysis
This dataset has a clear mixture of numerical fields and categorical attributes, which we can be clarified through providing codes. Furthermore, some attributes, such as Country, will allow us to perform a deeper analysis and form interesting questions about the dataset. Additionally, some attributes can be divided up further, such as day of the week, in order to aid in deeper analysis later.

Describe the analytical questions you want to answer with the data. Minimum of 3 major questions are required
What products have been purchased and returned the most?

What orders (that were later canceled) have the highest quantity?

How can the company maximize profits?

How can the company decrease costs?
How can the company increase sales?
Describe any concerns with the data and changes you expect to overcome
Dataset includes both cancellations and purchases, which can get confusing when looking at the data
No data dictionary included
Lack of dding columns such as transaction quarter and continent in order to add a layer to our data analysis
Data is very skewed and has a significantly larger amount of data regarding the European market, though they do ship to a number of regions outside of Europe.
Small number of information regarding consumers, which makes it difficult to provided detailed consumer insights on purchasing habits.
Overlapping records: one customer may have purchased several products in one transaction, while a specific product may have been purchased by many different consumers.
